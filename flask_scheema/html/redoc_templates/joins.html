## Joining Tables in API Queries
{% if model_relationship_names|length == 0 %}
This model does not have any relationships with other models.
{% else %}
You can join multiple model endpoints together to perform more complex queries. This is especially useful when you
want to retrieve related data from different tables in a single API call.

### Syntax

To join tables, use the `join` query parameter with a comma-separated list of the table names you wish to join.

- **Example**: `join={{ model_relationship_names[0] }}`

### Table Name Requirement

Once you include the `join` query parameter, it becomes mandatory to specify table names for all your other query
parameters. This is done to eliminate any ambiguity in the queries.

- **Example with Join and Fields**: `?join={{ relationship_table }}&fields={{ relationship_table }}.{{ relationship_columns[0] }},{{ base_table }}.{{ base_columns[0] }}`

### Tables That Can Be Joined

The following tables can be joined to this endpoint:

{% for model_relationship_name in model_relationship_names %}
- `{{ model_relationship_name }}`
{% endfor %}

By utilising table joins, you have the ability to make your API queries more expressive, enabling you to fetch
precisely the data you need in an efficient manner.
