Filters can be applied to most `GET` requests as query parameters. To apply a filter, use the following format:

- For columns in the default table: `{column}__{operator}={value}`
- For columns in a specific table: `{table}.{column}__{operator}={value1}`

**Note**: Fields are mandatory, table names are conditionally required.

### Operators

All filters require an operator, which should follow the column name, separated by a double underscore `__`. For example: `{column}__{operator}`.

Here is a list of supported operators:

- `__eq`: Equal To (`=`)
- `__ne`: Not Equal To (`!=`)
- `__lt`: Less Than (`<`)
- `__le`: Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)
- `__gt`: Greater Than (`>`)
- `__ge`: Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)
- `__in`: In `in`
- `__nin`: Not In `not in`
- `__like`: Like `like`
- `__ilike`: Case Insensitive Like `(case insensitive like)`
