FAQ
=========================================


.. dropdown:: Can I change the case of the output?


    Be default url endpoints are ``pluralized kebab-case``, resources are ``camelCase`` and resource fields are
    ``snake_case``.

    You can change the default behaviour easily by adding the below global flask configurations:

        `API_ENDPOINT_CASE <configuration.html#ENDPOINT_CASE>`_

        `API_FIELD_CASE <configuration.html#FIELD_CASE>`_

        `API_SCHEMA_CASE <configuration.html#SCHEMA_CASE>`_

    Options are: camel, pascal, snake, kebab, screaming_kebab, screaming_snake


.. dropdown:: Can I block http methods in my API?


    `Http method`_'s can be blocked easily, on a global or a model level. See here for full information on how to block
    methods.

        `API_BLOCK_METHODS <configuration.html#BLOCK_METHODS>`_

    Example blocking all ``DELETE`` & ``POST`` methods:


    .. code-block:: python

        app.config['API_BLOCK_METHODS'] = ['DELETE', 'POST]


    Example blocking ``DELETE`` & ``POST`` methods on a specific model:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyModel(Model):
            class Meta:
                block_methods = ['DELETE', 'POST']


    Alternatively, If you want to only allow ``GET`` requests you can turn on the
    `API_READ_ONLY <configuration.html#READ_ONLY>`_ option in the `Flask`_ configuration, which will block all but ``GET``
    requests from being served.


.. dropdown:: Can I extend the functionality of the API?


    If you need to perform some custom logic or actions, you can use callbacks. Callbacks are functions
    that fire:

    - before the database query is performed
    - before the data is returned to the api
    - on an exception being raised

    See the below configuration values that can be defined globally as `Flask`_ configurations or on a model level.

        `API_SETUP_CALLBACK <configuration.html#SETUP_CALLBACK>`_

        `API_RETURN_CALLBACK <configuration.html#RETURN_CALLBACK>`_

        `API_ERROR_CALLBACK <configuration.html#ERROR_CALLBACK>`_
